A rails engine to return various checks in json format.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'simple_health_check'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

### Creating an initializer
And use the following to configure.
```
# SimpleHealthCheck::Configuration.mount_at = 'custom_path'
# SimpleHealthCheck::Configuration.version_file = Rails.root.join('VERSION')
SimpleHealthCheck::Configuration.configure do |config|
  config.add_check SimpleHealthCheck::VersionCheck
end
```

### Adding new checks:
The default check:
* SimpleHealthCheck::BasicStatusCheck - returns "status": 1

Add more checks:
* SimpleHealthCheck::VersionCheck - reads from "VERSION" file or path with Configuration version_file =
* SimpleHealthCheck::MysqlCheck - wip
* SimpleHealthCheck::S3Check - wip
* SimpleHealthCheck::RedisCheck - wip

Derive new checks from `SimpleHealthCheck::Base` and write the `call` method.
